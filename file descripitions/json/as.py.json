Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Imports:**\n   - `OpenAI`: To interact with the OpenAI API.\n   - `os`: To get environment variables.\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - An `OpenAI` client is created with the base URL set to \"https://openrouter.ai/api/v1\" and the API key fetched from the environment variable 'OPENROUTER_API_KEY'.\n\n3. **API Call:**\n   - The client's `chat.completions.create` method is called with the following parameters:\n     - `model`: Set to \"mistralai/mistral-nemo\".\n     - `messages`: A list containing a single user message asking, \"What is the meaning of life?\"\n\n4. **Output:**\n   - The response from the API is printed, specifically the content of the message from the model's response.\n\nIn essence, this script sends a query to the \"mistralai/mistral-nemo\" model asking for the meaning of life and prints the model's response."}
