Please provide me with the source code file you'd like me to summarize. Here's an example of how I can assist you using a simple Python script:\n\n**Original code (file: `example.py`):**\n\n```python\ndef greet(name):\n    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n\ndef farewell(name):\n    print(f\"Goodbye, {name}!\")\n\ndef main():\n    greet(\"Alice\")\n    farewell(\"Bob\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- The script defines three functions: `greet`, `farewell`, and `main`.\n- The `greet` function takes a name as an argument and prints a greeting message.\n- The `farewell` function takes a name as an argument and prints a farewell message.\n- The `main` function calls `greet` with \"Alice\" and `farewell` with \"Bob\".\n- When the script is run, it first checks if it's the main module, and if so, it calls the `main` function.\n\nPlease provide the source code file you'd like me to summarize, and I'll give you a similar breakdown."}
