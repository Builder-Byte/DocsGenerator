It provides a simple interface for sending queries to the model and receiving summaries as responses.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to interact with the OpenRouter API using the `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model, abstracting away the details of API calls and allowing users to focus on sending queries and receiving summaries.\n\n## High-level Responsibilities\n\n- Initialize the OpenAI client with the provided API key.\n- Send queries to the `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model and return the generated summary.\n\n## Intended Use Cases\n\nThis class is intended for use in applications that require generating summaries or other text-based outputs using the `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model via the OpenRouter API. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing systems.\n\n## Architecture & Design\n\nThe `OpenRouterClient` class follows a simple design pattern, with a single method `summarize` responsible for sending queries to the model and returning the generated summary. It uses the OpenAI Python library to interact with the OpenRouter API.\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n\n- Single Responsibility Principle: The `OpenRouterClient` class has a single responsibility, which is to send queries to the `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model and return the generated summary.\n\n### Important Abstractions\n\n- The `OpenAI` client is used to interact with the OpenRouter API. It is initialized in the constructor of the `OpenRouterClient` class.\n\n## Dependencies and Integrations\n\n- `openai`: The OpenAI Python library is required to interact with the OpenRouter API. It can be installed using `pip install openai`.\n- An OpenRouter API key is required to authenticate requests to the OpenRouter API. It should be set as the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable.\n\n## Public Interfaces\n\n### `summarize(query: str) -> str`\n\nSends a query to the `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model and returns the generated summary.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `query` (str): The input query to send to the model.\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- `str`: The generated summary.\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n- `openai.error.OpenAIError`: If there is an error communicating with the OpenRouter API.\n\n### `__init__(self) -> None`\n\nInitializes the `OpenRouterClient` instance with the provided API key.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- None\n\n**Returns:**\n\n- None\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```python\nfrom openrouter_client import OpenRouterClient\n\n# Initialize the client with the API key\nclient = OpenRouterClient()\n\n# Send a query to the model and get the summary\nsummary = client.summarize(\"What is the purpose of this documentation?\")\nprint(summary)\n```\n\n## Edge Cases & Constraints\n\n- The `mistralai/mistral-nemo` model may not generate accurate or relevant summaries for all input queries. The quality of the generated summaries is dependent on the model's capabilities and the input data.\n- The OpenRouter API may have rate limits or other constraints that could affect the usage of this client. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that they are within the API's usage limits.\n- The OpenRouter API may change or become unavailable, which could affect the functionality of this client. It is recommended to monitor the OpenRouter API's status and update this client as needed.\n\n## Best Practices & Notes\n\n- Always set the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable before using this client to ensure that requests are properly authenticated.\n- This client does not include any rate limiting or error handling beyond what is provided by the OpenAI Python library. It is recommended to add additional error handling and rate limiting as needed for production use.\n- This client is designed to be used in a production environment, but it may also be useful for onboarding new engineers or long-term maintenance. It provides a clear and concise interface for interacting with the OpenRouter API, making it easy to understand and use."}
