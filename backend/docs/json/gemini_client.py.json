It provides a simple interface for sending queries to the Gemini model and receiving summarized responses.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this file is to provide a convenient way to interact with the Gemini model for summarization tasks. It abstracts the complexities of the GenAI client and provides a simple, easy-to-use interface for sending queries and receiving responses.\n\n## High-level Responsibilities\n\n- Initialize a GenAI client.\n- Provide a method for sending queries to the Gemini model and receiving summarized responses.\n\n## Intended Use Cases\n\n- Summarizing long texts or documents.\n- Extracting key points from large amounts of data.\n- Generating concise summaries for content creation or review.\n\n## Architecture & Design\n\nThe `GeminiClient` class follows a simple design pattern with a single responsibility: interacting with the Gemini model for summarization tasks. It uses the `genai` library to communicate with the GenAI service.\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n\n- Singleton pattern for the GenAI client to ensure only one instance is created.\n\n### Important Abstractions\n\n- The `genai.Client` class is used to interact with the GenAI service.\n\n### Dependencies and Integrations\n\n- `google-genai`: The library used to interact with Google's Generative AI service.\n\n## Public Interfaces\n\n### `summarize(query: str) -> str`\n\nSends a query to the Gemini model and returns a summarized response.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- `query` (str): The input text to be summarized.\n\n**Return value:**\n\n- `str`: The summarized response from the Gemini model.\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n- `Exception`: Any error that occurs during the request will be caught and re-raised as a generic exception.\n\n## Internal Logic\n\nThe `summarize` method constructs a prompt with a system instruction and the user's query. It then sends this prompt to the Gemini model using the `generate_content` method of the `genai.Client` class. The response from the model is returned as the summarized text.\n\n### Non-obvious Implementation Decisions\n\n- The system instruction is hardcoded in the prompt to ensure consistent behavior across different queries.\n- The Gemini model is specified as \"gemini-2.0-flash\" to ensure the use of the latest Gemini model for summarization tasks.\n\n## Configuration & Environment\n\n### Required Environment Variables\n\n- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: The API key for authenticating with the GenAI service.\n\n### External Services or Resources Used\n\n- Google's Generative AI (GenAI) service.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```python\nfrom gemini_client import GeminiClient\n\nclient = GeminiClient()\nsummary = client.summarize(\"Your long text or document goes here.\")\nprint(summary)\n```\n\n## Edge Cases & Constraints\n\n- The `summarize` method may return an empty string if the Gemini model fails to generate a summary.\n- The length of the input text is limited by the Gemini model's token limit (currently 2048 tokens).\n- The `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable must be set for the client to authenticate with the GenAI service.\n\n## Best Practices & Notes\n\n- Always validate the API key by checking if the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable is set.\n- Handle exceptions that may occur during the request to prevent unexpected failures.\n- Consider the token limit of the Gemini model when preparing input texts to avoid truncation.\n\n## Style Guidelines\n\n- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code.\n- Use clear and concise variable and function names.\n- Include docstrings for all public methods and classes.\n- Use type hints for function signatures to improve readability and maintainability.\n- Include comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.\n\n_This documentation is intended for production systems, onboarding new engineers, and long-term maintenance. It follows industry documentation standards similar to Google and Microsoft styles, using Markdown formatting and including code snippets where helpful._"
