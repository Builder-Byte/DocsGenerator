The extracted files are then zipped again and stored in the `output_zip` directory.\n\n## Architecture & Design\n\nThe application follows a simple, linear workflow:\n\n1. Accept a ZIP file upload.\n2. Validate the file type.\n3. Save the uploaded file.\n4. Extract the ZIP file contents.\n5. Summarize the extracted files using the `summarizer` function.\n6. Zip the summarized files again.\n7. Return a success message with details about the processed file.\n\n### Key Design Patterns\n\n- **Input/Output (I/O) Operations**: The application uses the `zipfile` library to handle ZIP file extraction and creation.\n- **Error Handling**: The application raises `HTTPException` for invalid file types or bad ZIP files.\n\n### Important Abstractions\n\n- **`summarizer` function**: Responsible for summarizing the contents of a given folder.\n- **`zip_folder` function**: Zips the contents of a specified folder.\n\n### Dependencies and Integrations\n\n- **FastAPI**: The application framework.\n- **`summarize` module**: The summarization functionality, which is not shown in the provided code.\n- **`zipfile` library**: Used for ZIP file extraction and creation.\n\n## Public Interfaces\n\n### `/` (GET)\n\nReturns a simple JSON response: `{\"Hello\": \"World\"}`\n\n### `/upload` (POST)\n\nAccepts a ZIP file upload and processes it as described in the [Overview](#overview) section.\n\n**Parameters**\n\n- `file` (File, required): The ZIP file to be uploaded.\n\n**Return value**\n\nA JSON response containing a success message and details about the processed file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"File uploaded and extracted successfully.\",\n  \"filename\": \"<uploaded_file_name>\",\n  \"extracted_to\": \"<extraction_path>\",\n  \"folder_to_be_summarized\": \"<summarized_folder_path>\"\n}\n```\n\n**Exceptions**\n\n- `400 Bad Request`: Raised when the uploaded file is not a ZIP file or the ZIP file is invalid.\n\n## Internal Logic\n\n### `summarizer` function\n\n```python\ndef summarizer(folder_to_be_summarized: str, name: str):\n    Summarize(folder_to_be_summarized, name).summarize()\n```\n\nThis function uses the `Summarize` class from the `summarize` module to summarize the contents of the specified folder. The implementation details of the `Summarize` class are not shown in the provided code.\n\n### `zip_folder` function\n\n```python\ndef zip_folder(name: str):\n    # ...\n```\n\nThis function zips the contents of the folder with the given name, located in the `output` directory, and stores the zipped file in the `output_zip` directory.\n\n## Configuration & Environment\n\n- **Environment Variables**: None required.\n- **Configuration Options**: None specified.\n- **External Services or Resources Used**: None specified.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n1. **Upload a ZIP file**:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: multipart/form-data\" -F \"file=@path/to/your/file.zip\" http://localhost:8000/upload\n```\n\nReplace `path/to/your/file.zip` with the path to your ZIP file.\n\n## Edge Cases & Constraints\n\n- **Limitation**: The application assumes that the uploaded ZIP file contains only one folder with the same name as the file (without the extension). If the ZIP file contains multiple folders or has a different structure, the summarization and zipping processes may not work as expected.\n- **Assumptions**: The application assumes that the `summarize` module and the `Summarize` class are available and functioning correctly.\n- **Performance Considerations**: The application may take some time to process large ZIP files, as it needs to extract their contents and summarize the files. Additionally, zipping the summarized files again may also take some time.\n\n## Best Practices & Notes\n\n- **Security Considerations**: The application does not perform any input validation on the extracted files, which could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if malicious ZIP files are uploaded. It is recommended to add input validation and sanitization for the extracted files.\n- **Maintainability Tips**: To improve maintainability, consider adding logging to track the progress of the file processing workflow. Additionally, consider adding tests to ensure that the application behaves as expected under different scenarios.\n- **Extension Points**: The application could be extended to support additional file types or to provide more detailed processing information in the response."}
